<p>User reviews for fluoxetine to treat binge eating disorder. It just completely killed my urge to uncontrollably eat myself to sickness however i do still “over eat” but i have control over it, i just love food haha like the other commenter said, if i stop taking it, within 6 or so weeks the urges come back strong and uncontrollable. That was the only binge eating i have really done in about 7 weeks now, so i have to say that overall prozac and cymbalta have definitely helped my binge eating. I've read mixed reports on how it can affect appetite, some people losing weight and some people gaining weight. Reddit Stack Vyvanse.</p>
